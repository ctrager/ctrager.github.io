    <h1>Corey Trager's HTML/Javascript Music Tools</h1>

    <p>
    Some music apps implemented as single html files. 
    <br>
    They all work offline. 
    <br>
    Mostly tested with desktop Chrome, but they probably work in other browsers and on mobile. Let me know if you don't at ctrager@yahoo.com

    <div><a href="metronome.html">Metronome.html</a> - a pretty decent metronome</div>
    <div><a href="tones.html">Drone Tones</a> - plays drone tones, which can help with violin intonation</div>
    <div><a href="pitch.html">Pitch Detector</a> - (work in progress) tries to tell you whether you are playing in tune</div>
